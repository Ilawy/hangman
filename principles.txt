what else principles (like SOLID) should i know to be ready to any interview 

Llama 3.3 70B:
To be well-prepared for any interview, it's essential to familiarize yourself with various principles and concepts in software development. Here are some key principles and concepts to consider:

* **SOLID principles**: As you mentioned, SOLID is a fundamental concept in object-oriented design. It stands for:
  * Single responsibility principle (SRP)
  * Open/closed principle (OCP)
  * Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
  * Interface segregation principle (ISP)
  * Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
* **Design patterns**: Knowledge of common design patterns, such as:
  * Creational patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory)
  * Structural patterns (e.g., Adapter, Bridge)
  * Behavioral patterns (e.g., Observer, Strategy)
* **Principles of clean code**:
  * Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  * Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)
  * You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
  * Command-Query Separation (CQS)
* **Testing principles**:
  * Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
  * Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  * Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
* **Agile and Scrum principles**:
  * Agile manifesto
  * Scrum framework
  * Kanban methodology
* **Database principles**:
  * Normalization
  * Denormalization
  * Data modeling
* **Security principles**:
  * OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines
  * Secure coding practices
  * Common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
* **Cloud computing principles**:
  * Scalability
  * High availability
  * Cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
* **DevOps principles**:
  * Continuous Integration (CI)
  * Continuous Deployment (CD)
  * Continuous Monitoring (CM)

Additionally, it's essential to have a good understanding of:

* **Data structures and algorithms**: Familiarize yourself with common data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph traversal).
* **Programming languages**: Be proficient in at least one programming language and have a basic understanding of others.
* **System design**: Understand how to design and architect systems, including microservices, monolithic architectures, and service-oriented architecture (SOA).

By familiarizing yourself with these principles and concepts, you'll be well-prepared to tackle a wide range of interview questions and demonstrate your expertise in software development.
